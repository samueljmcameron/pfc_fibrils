In this folder, I will plot R, psi(R), and maybe more vs gamma.

I am looking at, for gamma in [0.01,â€¦,0.4], every combination of 

k24 = [-1,-0.5,0,0.5,1]

omega = [0.1,0.5,1.0,5.0]

Lambda = [0.1,0.5,1.0,5.0,10.0,50.0,100.0,500.0]

General trends:

constant k24,constant Lambda, increasing omega:

nothing interesting
