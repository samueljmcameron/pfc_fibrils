This folder has an experiment where with ONLY ONE SET OF (K33,k24,gamma_s,d0), I am looking at the double well behaviour of the energy along a line x(t) = x0+t*(x1-x0), where xi = (Ri,etai,deltai)'.

For a range of omega=Lambda's, this double well behaviour exists. So I'm looking at the evolution of the double well as omega=Lambda is varied.
