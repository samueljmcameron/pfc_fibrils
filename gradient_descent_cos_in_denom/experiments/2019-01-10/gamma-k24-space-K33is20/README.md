This experiment calculated k24 vs gamma plots of the observables. For this run, I am looking at the space from k24 = -1 to 1 and gamma = 0.01 to 0.4, in a 2d (4x4) grid of (Lambda,omega) coordinates, where Lambda[1..4] = (0.1,1.0,10.0,100.0) and omega[1..4] = (0.01,0.1,1.0,10.0).

To make a calculation of any observable vs gamma, run the script "run_cc.h <Lambda> <omega> <k24index>" where <Lambda> is the numerical value for Lambda, <omega> is the numerical value for omega, and <k24index> is the index of the k24 array (set in scan2d.py, see below) corresponding to the value of k24 that you want to compute.

The range of gamma values to be calculated (i.e. gamma = 0.01 to gamma = 0.4 in this case) and k24 values to be calculated (i.e. k24 = -1 to k24 = 1) must be set manually within the python script "scan2d.py". All other parameters (beside gamma, k24, omega range, and Lambda range) are set in the input.dat file.
