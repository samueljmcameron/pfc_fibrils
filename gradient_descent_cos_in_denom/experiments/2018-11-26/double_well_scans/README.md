This folder has an experiment where with ONLY ONE SET OF (K33,k24,gamma_s,d0) = (30.0,0.7,0.1,1.0), I am looking at the double well behaviour of the energy along a line x(t) = x0+t*(x1-x0), where xi = (Ri,etai,deltai)'.


For a range of omega=Lambda's, this double well behaviour exists, but to keep the plot clean I'll look at the extreme values, which for this set of parameters is roughly Lambda = omega = 19.0 and Lambda = omega = 24.0. I also want to look at the phase transition point, which is around Lambda = omega = 21.5.
