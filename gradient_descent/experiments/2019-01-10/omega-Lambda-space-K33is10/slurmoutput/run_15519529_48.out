something is too big or less than zero, so returning failed calculation.
likely a maximizing (vs minimizing) solution for psi(r), as y[1][2]=-3.383662e-05  which usually means high energy.
solvde convergence failed when x = (1.095927e+00,7.050750e+00,8.072390e-01).
Retrying using a constant y value
the initial guesses were not good, did not successfully find a minimum.
